**Proxy Inference Engine (PIE)** is the specialized inference layer developed by The Proxy Company, built upon the foundation of Apple's [MLX framework](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx). It is designed for high-performance execution of language models (including VLMs) on Apple Silicon hardware, with tight integration for the unique requirements of the [Proxy Structuring Engine (PSE)](https://github.com/TheProxyCompany/proxy-structuring-engine) and the [Proxy Base Agent (PBA)](https://github.com/TheProxyCompany/proxy-base-agent).

This engine is the successor to the experimental `mlx-proxy` repository (now archived).
